body will lie in state for three days the online reactions to the death of Pope Benedict XVI have been rather mixed that's largely due to the perception that he could have taken more action against sexual abuse claims that have rocked the church before and during his papal tenure take a look at this for example it's a statement put out by snap a survivor's Network for people who faced abuse in the church in it they directly accused the former pope of being an abuse enabler saying that Benedict was more concerned about the church's deteriorating image and financial flow than making true amends to victims of abuse and it's not just alleged claims of impropriety while he was Pope in this report commissioned by the church in Munich put out in 2022 Cardinal Joseph ratzinger as the then former Pope was known was directly implicated in sexual abuse claims for priests that he was responsible for now he's always denied any wrongdoing personally however it's the scale or some of these allegations that have made people angry online the same report notes how at least 497 victims were involved more than half of whom were between the ages of just 6 to 14. now on the other hand some online has sought to defend the former Pope with starting the process of kicking out or defrocking abusive priests from the church however for many victims groups firing certain abusive priests is never going to be enough to atone for some of the serious crimes that they committed for these people Benedict's death is not a moment to remember his life but it's another painful reminder of tragic events thousands of people queued to enter the ground of Payless former Club Santos in order to pay their respect to the world famous player the Brazilian icon died last week aged 82.

telegram he said his forces would respond to any attacks by Ukraine much of eastern Ukraine remains gripped by intensive daily combat Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a 36-hour truce for Orthodox Christmas after an appeal from the Russian patriarch but it was immediately rejected by Ukraine as a ploy to allow moscow's forces to recuperate and regroup Russia has announced unilateral Christmas ceasefire is likely an information operation intended to damage Ukraine's reputations as the institute for the study of War Vladimir Putin instructed Russian defense minister Sergey shoigu to initiate a ceasefire from midday on the 6th of January until midnight on the 7th of January along the entire line of contact between parties in Ukraine Ukrainian and Western officials immediately highlighted the hypocrisy of the ceasefire announcement and to emphasized that Russian forces have launched over 40 missiles at Ukrainian cities continuing striking military and civilian infrastructure on the 25th of December when many ukrainians celebrate Christmas Putin could have been seeking to secure a 36 hour pause for Russian troops to rest recoup and reorient to relaunch offensive operations in critical sectors of the front to frame Ukrainian forces unwilling to work towards peace and wanting to fight at all costs and to frame Ukraine as suppressing religious groups and position Putin as the true protector of the Christian faith now this both would disproportionately benefit Russian troops and begin to deprive Ukraine of its initiatives as the institute for the

Prince Harry's highly anticipated Memoir spare for most of my life from losing his mother to losing his virginity it seems there will be few stories unturned when it officially hits bookshelves on Tuesday I felt closest to my mother they reveal Prince Harry claims he killed 25 Taliban fighters when he was a soldier in Afghanistan he says he thought of them as chess pieces not people other claims delved further into the tense family situation when his father King Charles first introduced Camilla to his sons Harry talks of fearing a wicked stepmother and discouraged his dad from marrying the now Queen consort the Duke of Sussex has also opened up about using cocaine and losing his virginity to an older woman but there is also a deep seam of unresolved grief with repeated references to his mother Princess Diana who died in a car crash in Paris in 1997. does Prince Harry's claim that he killed 25 Taliban soldiers threatened his security now while it's not illegal for British Personnel to discuss how many people they've killed it does go against convention and it's been highly criticized online take a look at this for example one former Royal Navy service person took to Twitter saying I've always had time for Prince Harry but this claim has broken an unbroken rule in the armed forces you don't discuss who and how many people you've killed ever now even a former British Marine who served with Harry and was described as a hero by the prince after losing two limbs had strong words for him online he said love you Prince Harry but you need to shut up more worryingly those in Afghanistan have criticized the prince quite a lot for describing his kills as chess pieces take a look at this for example this is a Taliban leader in Afghanistan and he said Mr Harry the ones you killed were not chess pieces they were humans they had families who were waiting for their return now that's a view widely held by Afghans on social media here's another one which is pretty direct and quite threatening it says bloodthirst of the century may God curse the terrorists of the West and their allies and it includes a very large picture of Harry with a cross through it now this could make life for Harry security team much harder he could face more threats due to his history in the Army he's currently suing the British government to allow him to play for police protection in the UK it's a privilege he gave up in 2020 after he stopped being a working Royal now some online have noted a sense of irony here that this Revelation about the Taliban kills which is generated near Universal criticism could work against the prince's hopes to increase security for both him and his family there's little respite when it comes to inflation as European consumers battle

there is no price pressure from their side to to raise prices and secondly wages increase much less than inflation implying that consumers have a reduced purchasing power and they will consume fewer

and army Chief of Staff several European parliamentarians and military officials French intellectual burnout only Levy and three senior staffers at the French satirical magazine Shalia doe have also been targeted jiren who spoke to Dutch MEP Tice wrighten who is one of those who's been blacklisted I think they are in panic and they feel uh very weak that's why they moved to these kind of measurements and it's bizarre that the regime thinks that they can silence the European Parliament the contrary is true I'm even more motivated to continue our efforts to name the Revolutionary guard for what it is a terrorist organization that is terrorizing its own people and also waging terrorist methods outside Iran the MEP says that being sanctioned by Tehran makes them even more committed and determined to support Iranians against the regime personally there is not much impact because I feel even more encouraged to continue to support the Iranians in Iran that are resisting their their regime and fighting for Freedom so I think politically we will even be more motivated and more vocal what we think of this regime meanwhile Iran claims the latest EU sanctions made a week ago breached

inflation in Hungary running at 24.5 percent compared to 15.4 percent in Slovakia it pays to shop abroad across because petrol is cheaper here again when the Bridge opened 20 odd years ago it was also the same and I can tell you that we didn't just come for petrol we also go to little where the beer and the cheese is also cheaper food prices are horrible and Hungary now especially cheese we have a business trip here in pakani and we thought we'd combine that with a lunch and shopping and they were obviously curious to see how much more favorable the fuel prices it's not that much more favorable the difference is about 10 euro cents I filled it with diesel obviously the exchange rate of the euro is a little better now compared to the Hungarian foreign and that makes it a little more favorable there are parts of Hungary where a trip across the border can yield even greater savings about 1500 people live in the town of kubikaza in southern Hungary the town's mayor is not a fan of President Orban or his party and has no qualms about Crossing into Romania to fill up the town's Fleet of Municipal minibuses the head of a municipality I can't waste money like our government does we have therefore decided that we'll go from kubikaza to the petrol station next to a small town in Romania to refuel it's about a quarter of a Euro cheaper per liter for fuel and we have to refuel two or three times a month so it does matter the government claims there's huge 25 inflation in Hungary due to EU sanctions against Russia Fuel and many products are cheaper in several neighboring EU countries such as Slovakia Romania and Croatia builds up their car in Slovakia instead of Hungary can save around 8 000 Hungarian Florence or 20 euros the general experience is that it's worth going

been targeted jiren who spoke to Dutch MEP Tice wrighten who is one of those who's been blacklisted I think they are in panic and they feel uh very weak that's why they moved to these kind of measurements and it's bizarre that the regime thinks that they can silence the European Parliament the contrary is true I'm even more motivated to continue our efforts to name the Revolutionary guard for what it is a terrorist organization that is terrorizing its own people and also waging terrorist methods outside Iran the MEP says that being sanctioned by Tehran makes them even more committed and determined to support Iranians against the regime personally there is not much impact because I feel even more encouraged to continue to support the Iranians in Iran that are resisting their their regime and fighting for Freedom so I think politically we will even be more motivated and more vocal what we think of this regime meanwhile Iran claims the latest EU sanctions made a week ago breached

inflation in Hungary running at 24.5 percent compared to 15.4 percent in Slovakia it pays to shop abroad across because petrol is cheaper here again when the Bridge opened 20 odd years ago it was also the same and I can tell you that we didn't just come for petrol we also go to little where the beer and the cheese is also cheaper food prices are horrible and Hungary now especially cheese we have a business trip here in pakani and we thought we'd combine that with a lunch and shopping and they were obviously curious to see how much more favorable the fuel prices it's not that much more favorable the difference is about 10 euro cents I filled it with diesel obviously the exchange rate of the euro is a little better now compared to the Hungarian foreign and that makes it a little more favorable there are parts of Hungary where a trip across the border can yield even greater savings about 1500 people live in the town of kubikaza in southern Hungary the town's mayor is not a fan of President Orban or his party and has no qualms about Crossing into Romania to fill up the town's Fleet of Municipal minibuses the head of a municipality I can't waste money like our government does we have therefore decided that we'll go from kubikaza to the petrol station next to a small town in Romania to refuel it's about a quarter of a Euro cheaper per liter for fuel and we have to refuel two or three times a month so it does matter the government claims there's huge 25 inflation in Hungary due to EU sanctions against Russia Fuel and many products are cheaper in several neighboring EU

invasion could be prevented the german government has clearly agreed that we will not send any legal weapons no arms deliveries to crisis areas because we do not want to fuel these conflicts even

czech republic and poland among those to announce record number of daily cases but with the virus proving less deadly than in previous waves 2022 for now remains optimistic across the continent welcome to the cube germany has begun debating about whether to make covid19 vaccines mandatory but at the same time across the country and indeed across europe we are still seeing protests and sometimes violent protests from anti-vaccine demonstrators one of the ways that conspiracy theories are being shared and these protesters are being mobilized is on telegram now telegram is an encrypted messaging service that is gaining popularity in countries like germany but recently senior politicians have voiced concerns that what is being shared on telegram is indecent and sometimes criminal and it was just last month that german police uncovered a group on telegram that had been sending death threats to a state governor now all of this has led the german government to toughen its stance on telegram the new interior minister nancy fazer said this month that by easter they plan to have in place controls on telegram they plan to force the app not just to remove any content that contains hate beats and death threats but also to identify those people who are sending it this will bring telegram in line with other popular platforms like facebook and twitter and that's important because when facebook and twitter last year removed anti-vaccine groups these groups moved to alternative platforms like telegram and nancy phaser says that if telegram does not comply with the new rules then it could be fined or even banned completely and that would make germany the first western country to outlaw telegram as a platform but there are still some things to consider firstly telegram has always said it aims to operate outside of government controls and there are also concerns that even if germany does ban telegram those anti-vaccine protesters will simply move to another platform where there is less regulation and where they can continue to spread conspiracy theories foreign the vatican has strongly defended pope benedict's record in fighting clergy sexual

animalistic within us as humans and he felt to some degree that there was only our civilization our manners are the way we behave with each other it's just a very thin veneer overlaying what are essentially sort of animalistic instincts that we also have as human bacon's talent was only fully realized in the horrifically animalistic paintings of people he produced just as the nazi

goes ahead with the reform as the pools open for the second round of the Czech presidential elections there's been another very bizarre twist with fake news surrounding one of the candidates Peter Pavel multiple Czech news outlets as well as multiple social media users said that they've received emails announcing the former General had died suddenly read before the election the emails included a link to our website nearly identical to Peter pavel's official one and the people behind this bizarre fake death announcement even went as far as writing an obituary for the candidate Peter Pavel reacted on Twitter saying that the level of disinformation had hit a new low during this campaign he tweeted yes I'm alive I never thought I would have to write this on the web someone is sending out a fake version of my website with the news of my death on behalf of my spokesperson but later that day the former General jokingly posted this tweet photoshopping him himself onto the famous uh James Bond movie poster no time to Die the second round of the presidential election is being held this Saturday as well as this Friday pitting the ex-nato official Pavel against the former prime minister Andrei bavis and even Babas responded to the fake death announcement of his opponent on Twitter saying even though we are Rivals I absolutely agree with you it's disgusting and I'm sorry that anyone would stoop down to such a thing the police should look into the Sterly just like they did with the anonymous person who threatened me Andrei Babas claims that he's received death threats recently and a letter with a bullet casing had been mailed to this to his wife this week so who is behind these emails well we don't really know for sure and the police is still investigating the case but according to Czech media and experts many have found that the website is anonymous and that the emails on that domain were routed through a Russian Yandex web portal Philip rosenick a Czech media analyst concluded that in short someone put in a lot of effort to hide their tracks and to not be traceable earlier this week here in the cube we covered also the very strange messages that some voters claimed to have received from Peter pavel's team asking them to go to the nearest branch of the Armed Forces in order to receive equipment to be mobilized to Ukraine to this day it's still unclear who is behind these text messages as well as behind the whole fake death announcement but one thing that's for sure it's an election marred by what observers call an alarming level of disinformation foreign may be ravaged by War before these children in cave there is at least sometimes the semblance of a normal life on top of their lessons they also go outside to pick berries for

because Border Police can't process passports quickly enough on the first Services between London and the EU a direct consequence of the more rigorous passport checks required since brexit it's particularly just frustrating when you're someone who didn't hope to leave Europe um yeah and I think it's really important especially to my generation to be able to travel freely I'm traveling for work today and so it makes a big difference to my ability to do my job in Europe um yeah and it's a real shame what have you noticed what's the difference the cues are much longer at the passport controls there's actually much more separation of people so if you have a UK passport versus if you have a European passport like there's a clear distinction where you're going um and the lanes are like with a French passport first thing I have a French passport so I get through pretty quickly but I see the UK people like spending a lot of time most of the times the pandemic kept travel to a minimum but following a surge in returning commuters and tourists wait times increased to the point that Eurostar capped the number of passengers leaving Peak capacity 30 percent lower than in 2019. since brexit British passports are processed separately and it's meant that passengers are now being asked by Eurostar to arrive 19 minutes before their train departs but despite that there is still bottlenecks at Eurostar stations and it means the trains leaving first thing in the morning are Never full up to 250 seats empty every single day Eurostar says it's hoping both the UK and the EU bring in more Border Police and install extra electronic gates to reduce check-in time at the station until that happens commuters will have to think further ahead to secure a seat at the busiest times Luke

to verify teran's involvement in last Saturday's operation Dr San goal from the London based agent Pacific Foundation seems to think so along with the sheer ferocity of imagination the scale of it preventing any leakage of information uh so you also have to factor in that Hamas has got a lot of support uh tactical strategic and financial backing from Iran who have been able to operate in many ways uh in various gues around the world so Hamas may be taking a lead out of Iran's book there should be no doubt that one of the motivations behind the Hamas operation was to prevent normalization
